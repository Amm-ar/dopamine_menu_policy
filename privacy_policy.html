    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: January 08, 2026</p>

    <p>Dopamine Menu ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Data:</strong> The Dopamine Menu app is designed to function primarily offline. Your habits, completion history, and usage statistics are stored locally on your device using Hive storage. We do not transmit this personal habit data to our servers.</p>
    <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information automatically, such as device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for the purpose of ad delivery and app performance monitoring.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>To support the development and maintenance of this app, we integrate third-party advertising services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start.io (StartApp):</strong> We use Start.io to display advertisements. Start.io may collect and use certain data (such as IP address, device ID, and usage data) to serve personalized ads. Please refer to <a href="https://www.start.io/policy/privacy-policy/">Start.io's Privacy Policy</a> for more details.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>We use local storage (Hive) to save your progress. This data remains on your device and is deleted if you uninstall the app or clear its data. We do not have access to your locally stored habits.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Dopamine Menu does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
